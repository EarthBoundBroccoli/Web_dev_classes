Web 1.0
The "Static Web," marks the early era of the World Wide Web. 
During this phase, websites had static pages with content that rarely changed. 
The focus was primarily on delivering information, like reading a digital brochure or a static document. 
Interaction was minimal, and users were passive recipients of information, consuming content. 
Examples of Web 1.0 technologies include HTML and CSS.

Web 2.0
The "Social Web" or "Interactive Web," revolutionized the internet by promoting user interaction and content creation. 
This era saw the rise of social media platforms, blogs, wikis, and other collaborative tools that allowed users to generate and share content. 
Websites became more dynamic and responsive. 
The focus shifted from static content delivery to interactive, community-driven platforms where users could engage with one another. 
Notable examples include Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube.

Web 3.0
The "Semantic Web," represents the next evolution of the internet, aiming to create a more intelligent and connected web. 
This era focuses on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technologies to enable more meaningful and personalized interactions. 
The goal is to develop systems that understand and interpret data in a human-like way, facilitating more efficient information usage. 
Web 3.0 also emphasizes decentralization, providing greater control and privacy to users by reducing reliance on centralized entities. 
Examples of Web 3.0 technologies include decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum.
